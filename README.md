# Hi, I'm Lee Duxbury 👋

I'm a career changer, transitioning from **Construction Project Management** to **Software Development**. After 4 years in construction management, I discovered my passion for problem-solving and tech, so I decided to switch gears and start learning how to code using Codecademy. I enrolled in the **NorthCoders** bootcamp in October 2024 and Graduated in January 2024. 

I have gained solid experience with **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **React**, **Express**, and **SQL** through various hands-on projects and exercises. My background in project management has given me a strong foundation in teamwork, deadlines, and effective communication, which I’m excited to apply in the tech world.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Frameworks**: React, Express, Node.js, Redux
- **Database**: SQL, PostgreSQL
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub
- **Others**: RESTful APIs, Agile Methodology, Testing (Jest)

## 💻 Featured Projects
### [Project 1: NC News Backend]
- **Description**: Using PostgreSQL, Node.js and Jest for testing, I created a backend RESTful API to manage requests from the front end web app that would later be created. The project was then hosted using Supabase and Render.
- **Key Features**: Manages requests from the frontend web app (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE). Retrieve, update, and delete articles, as well as manage article votes and comments. Fetch and filter articles by specific topics.
Add, retrieve, and delete comments related to articles. Access a list of all users in the system. 
- **Challenges**: One of the main challenges I encountered was implementing robust error handling across all endpoints, especially when managing different HTTP status codes like 404 and 500.
- Ensuring that the API could return the correct error message for invalid data or missing resources required a lot of attention to detail and testing.
- Another challenge was optimizing the SQL queries to handle sorting, filtering, and joining data efficiently, particularly when dealing with dynamic query parameters for sorting and filtering articles by topic.

### [Project 2: NC News Frontend]
- **Description**: This project is the frontend of the NC News application, a news aggregation platform built with React. It allows users to view articles, vote on them, and comment on them, with a clean and responsive interface.
  The frontend interacts with the backend API to fetch data on articles, topics, comments, and user interactions.
- **Key Features**: Article Listing: View and sort articles by date or vote count.
Article Details: View detailed information about articles, including comments and votes.
 Voting: Upvote or downvote articles.
 Commenting: Add and manage comments on articles.
 Topic Filtering: Browse articles related to specific topics.
 User Context: Displays user information and avatar throughout the app using React's Context API.
- **Challenges**: State Management: Managing global state with React Context API for user data and article states was a challenge, as it required ensuring that data was consistently available across different components.
 API Integration: Handling asynchronous API calls for articles, comments, and votes posed challenges, especially in synchronizing data and managing loading states while keeping the UI responsive.
 Routing and Conditional Rendering: Setting up routing with React Router and implementing conditional rendering for features like showing detailed article views or topic pages required careful structuring of components and logic flow.
 Styling Responsiveness: Ensuring the app was responsive and visually consistent across different screen sizes required careful planning and CSS styling adjustments, especially for complex layouts like the article cards and topic pages.
